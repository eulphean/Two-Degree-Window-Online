# Two Degree Window
In 2019, Amay Kataria was invited to create an online version of [Two Degree Window](https://github.com/eulphean/Two-Degree-Window-Art-A-Hack) to be a part of [Fixity Equals Death](https://space-p11.com/f-d#:~:text=Fixity%20Equals%20Death%20is%20a,and%20other%20new%20media%20art.&text=Fixity%20Equals%20Death%20is%20part,terrain%20enveloped%20by%20digital%20colonialism.). The project was showcased at the Wrong Biennale and also at a physical gallery called Space P11 in Chicago. This project is an interactive website that presents a map to the user as soon as they land on the website. The user can interact with this several timezones on this map, which shows the sliver of time within which humankind must restructure global energy infrastructure to avoid locking in a 2 degree global temperature rise, which is widely viewed as catastrophic. The clock countdown is based on the work done by Nick Evershed at The Guardian, who calculated the timeline for a data visualization, based on IPCC reports.
