              The 2° Window project literally moves the needle on climate change. With world leaders denying the melting of the ice caps, and the disappearing of most wildlife; it feels like it’s time for everyday people to start making the change — even if it is in small degrees. This work brings awareness to climate change by displaying the sliver of time within which humankind must restructure global energy infrastructure to avoid locking in a 2 degree global temperature rise, which is widely viewed as catastrophic. The clock countdown is based on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2017/jan/19/carbon-countdown-clock-how-much-of-the-worlds-carbon-budget-have-we-spent">work done by Nick Evershed</a> at The Guardian, who calculated the timeline for a data visualization, based on IPCC reports.<br /><br />2° Window was originally developed as a site-specific installation at the 2018, Art-A-Hack residency at ThoughtWorks, New York City and is reinterpretted as a web project by Amay Kataria. The <a href="https://artahack.io/projects/climate-consciousness/">Climate Consciousness</a> team at Art-A-Hack comprised of Yidan Zeng, Anny Chang, Andrew McWilliams, and Amay Kataria, who investigated the psychological impact of the climate crisis on our society. Here is a video for the project put together by Andrew McWilliams.

              We talk about sustainability as this external thing, but it is a mind set. Are individuals today sustainable? Sustainability as an external construct and as something separate from what we are usually doing. When it must ideally be a shift in mindset as something that is almost like a renaissance – when technology changed the way we approach everything in the world. And creating a complete lifestyle shift in the way we look at progress and growth. Sustainability has become a charged word and rightly so; with our denial towards climate change and the depletion of natural resources. We need the same kind of turning of the wheel by working together in order to tackle a problem of this magnitude. This countdown clock is one that mankind must watch from the corner of its eye in order to keep track of its own impending doom.
